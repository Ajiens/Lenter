## About this project

The Book Music Project allows users to read books while enjoying music. The project uses a Django backend (currently relying on a local API) to fetch book and music objects. As my first Flutter project, I concentrated on the front end, meticulously slicing the prototype app to achieve 99% accuracy with Figma design prototypes.
